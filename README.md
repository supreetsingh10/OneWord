# OneWord
 Tkinterapp
 I am an avid reader and I look up meanings of words I don't know, so I created an app that will use the Pydictionary to find the meanings of the words I don't know. Using the tkinter module the words that I look up can be saved for later reference. 
 The button "vocabulary" will open the save file, while save, will write the word and the meaning I looked up in the save.txt
